# ✅ Analytics Page Fixed!

## 🐛 Issue
Analytics page was not showing data or updating because the SQL queries were using the wrong column name.

## 🔧 Root Cause
The analytics queries were looking for `current_funds` column, but the actual database uses `total_pledged` column.

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Fixed Queries (7 functions):
1. ✅ **getTopCampaigns** - Top campaigns by funding
2. ✅ **getFailedCampaigns** - Failed campaigns list
3. ✅ **getCampaignPerformance** - Campaign metrics
4. ✅ **getUserEngagementStats** - User statistics
5. ✅ **getCampaignSuccessRates** - Success rate calculations
6. ✅ **predictCampaignSuccess** - ML prediction
7. ✅ **getPlatformStats** - Platform-wide statistics

### Changes Made:
- Changed `c.current_funds` → `c.total_pledged`
- Added `COALESCE()` for null safety
- Fixed percentage calculations with `* 100.0`
