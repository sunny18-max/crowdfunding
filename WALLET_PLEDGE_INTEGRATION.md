# 💰 Wallet Integration with Pledges - Complete Guide

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

Your pledge system now **automatically deducts money from your wallet** when you back a project!

---

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### When You Make a Pledge:

#### 1. **Balance Check** ✅
```
Before pledge: Check if you have enough money
- Your balance: $1000
- Pledge amount: $100
- ✅ Sufficient? Proceed
- ❌ Insufficient? Show error
```

#### 2. **ACID Transaction** (All or Nothing) ✅
```
Step 1: Deduct from your wallet (-$100)
Step 2: Create pledge record
Step 3: Update campaign total (+$100)
Step 4: Mark transaction as "committed"
Step 5: Log wallet transaction

If ANY step fails → Everything rolls back!
```

#### 3. **Wallet Transaction Log** ✅
```
Every pledge creates a wallet transaction:
- Type: Debit
- Amount: $100
- Balance Before: $1000
- Balance After: $900
- Description: "Pledge to campaign: Smart Home Hub"
```

## 🎯 Complete Flow Example

### Scenario: Backing a $500 Project

**Before Pledge:**
- Your wallet balance: $1,000
- Campaign total: $10,000

**You Click "Pledge Now" with $500:**

1. ✅ System checks: Do you have $500? YES
2. ✅ System checks: Is campaign active? YES
3. ✅ System checks: Is deadline valid? YES
4. ✅ **TRANSACTION STARTS** (ACID)
   - Deduct $500 from your wallet
   - Create pledge record
   - Add $500 to campaign total
   - Mark transaction as committed
   - Log wallet transaction
5. ✅ **TRANSACTION COMMITS**

**After Pledge:**
- Your wallet balance: $500 ✅
- Campaign total: $10,500 ✅
- Pledge recorded: $500 ✅
- Transaction logged: Debit $500 ✅

## 📊 What Gets Updated in Database

### 1. **users** table:
```sql
UPDATE users 
SET wallet_balance = wallet_balance - 500 
WHERE id = your_id;

-- Your balance: $1000 → $500
```

### 2. **pledges** table:
```sql
INSERT INTO pledges (user_id, campaign_id, amount) 
VALUES (your_id, campaign_id, 500);

-- New pledge record created
```

### 3. **campaigns** table:
```sql
UPDATE campaigns 
SET total_pledged = total_pledged + 500 
WHERE id = campaign_id;

-- Campaign total: $10,000 → $10,500
```

### 4. **transactions** table:
```sql
INSERT INTO transactions (pledge_id, status, processed_at) 
VALUES (new_pledge_id, 'committed', NOW());

-- Transaction marked as committed
```

### 5. **wallet_transactions** table:
```sql
INSERT INTO wallet_transactions (
  user_id, 
  transaction_type, 
  amount, 
  balance_before, 
  balance_after,
  reference_type,
  reference_id,
  description
) VALUES (
  your_id,
  'debit',
  500,
  1000,
  500,
  'pledge',
  pledge_id,
  'Pledge to campaign: Smart Home Hub'
);

-- Complete audit trail created
```

## 🛡️ ACID Properties Demonstrated

### **Atomicity** (All or Nothing)
```
✅ All 5 operations succeed together
❌ If any fails, ALL are rolled back
Example: If wallet deduction works but pledge insert fails
→ Wallet deduction is ROLLED BACK
→ Your money is safe!
```

### **Consistency** (Valid State)
```
✅ Wallet balance always matches transactions
✅ Campaign total always matches pledges
✅ No money disappears or appears
```

### **Isolation** (No Interference)
```
✅ Two people pledging at same time don't interfere
✅ Each transaction is isolated
✅ No race conditions
```

### **Durability** (Persists)
```
✅ Once committed, changes are permanent
✅ Survives server crashes
✅ Data is safe in database
```

## 🚨 Error Handling

### Error 1: Insufficient Balance
```json
{
  "error": "Insufficient wallet balance",
  "required": 500,
  "available": 300
}
```
**Solution:** Add funds to your wallet first!

### Error 2: Campaign Not Active
```json
{
  "error": "Campaign is not active"
}
```
**Solution:** Can only pledge to active campaigns

### Error 3: Own Campaign
```json
{
  "error": "Cannot pledge to your own campaign"
}
```
**Solution:** You can't back your own project

### Error 4: Deadline Passed
```json
{
  "error": "Campaign deadline has passed"
}
```
**Solution:** Campaign is closed

## 🎓 For Viva/Presentation

### Talking Points:

**1. ACID Transaction Demo:**
> "When a user makes a pledge, we use an ACID transaction to ensure data consistency. The wallet is debited, pledge is created, campaign total is updated, and transaction is logged - all atomically. If any step fails, everything rolls back."

**2. Wallet Integration:**
> "Every pledge automatically deducts from the user's wallet balance. We check for sufficient funds before processing and maintain a complete audit trail of all transactions."

**3. Error Handling:**
> "The system validates multiple conditions: sufficient balance, active campaign, valid deadline, and prevents self-pledging. Each error provides clear feedback to the user."

**4. Database Consistency:**
> "Five tables are updated in a single transaction: users (wallet), pledges, campaigns (total), transactions (status), and wallet_transactions (audit log). This demonstrates complex multi-table ACID transactions."
